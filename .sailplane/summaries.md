I've created a modern, responsive personal website for you that showcases your academic and research background. The website includes:

1. Clean, professional design with a responsive layout
2. Sections for:
   - About: Overview of your background and research interests
   - Research: Current projects and areas of expertise
   - Education: Academic timeline from B.S./B.A. through current PhD
   - Publications: Overview of your research contributions
   - Contact: Professional contact information

Key features:
- Smooth scrolling navigation
- Responsive design that works on all devices
- Modern animations and transitions
- Professional color scheme
- Clear typography and layout

The website is currently running locally and can be accessed by opening index.html in a web browser. You can review the content and styling, and we can make any adjustments needed before deploying it to a web server.

I've updated the publications section with the following improvements:

1. All publications now have clickable titles that link to their respective DOIs:
   - Science Robotics paper
   - Introduction to Nanoengineering textbook
   - Materials Science and Haptic Perception paper
   - Journal of Physical Chemistry B paper

2. Improved styling:
   - Removed visible DOI numbers for a cleaner look
   - Added subtle hover animation on publication titles
   - Maintained consistent formatting across all entries
   - Clean hierarchy with authors and journal information

The publications section now provides a more professional and streamlined presentation while maintaining easy access to the full papers through DOI links.

I've optimized the website's hero section and image display with the following improvements:

1. Reduced Banner Height
   - Set to 70vh for standard displays
   - Responsive adjustments: 60vh for larger screens, 50vh for mobile
   - Added max-height: 800px for very large displays
   - This helps reduce image pixelation by showing a smaller portion of the images

2. Enhanced Image Display
   - Reduced blur effect (0.5px instead of 1px) for sharper image quality
   - Maintained contrast and brightness adjustments for better text readability
   - Added subtle scale animation (1.05 to 1.1) during transitions
   - Images now smoothly zoom during their display duration

3. Improved Overlay
   - Refined gradient overlay for better text contrast
   - Adjusted opacity levels for optimal balance between visibility and aesthetics
   - Smooth transitions between slides

These changes result in a more polished presentation of your molecular simulation images while maintaining readability and professional appearance. When you have higher resolution images available, they can be easily swapped in while maintaining these optimized display settings.
