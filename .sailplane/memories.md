### Task
Update publications section in personal website to hide DOIs and ensure all publications are properly linked

### Artifact
1. Modified index.html to:
   - Remove visible DOI spans
   - Add clickable links to all publications using their DOIs
   - Wrap publication titles in anchor tags
   ```html
   <h4>
       <a href="https://doi.org/[DOI]" target="_blank" class="publication-title">
           [Publication Title]
       </a>
   </h4>
   ```

2. Updated styles.css to:
   - Remove DOI-specific styling
   - Enhance publication title hover effects
   ```css
   .publication-title {
       color: var(--primary-color);
       text-decoration: none;
       transition: all 0.3s ease;
       display: inline-block;
       position: relative;
   }

   .publication-title:hover {
       color: var(--secondary-color);
       transform: translateX(5px);
   }
   ```

3. Added DOI links for all publications:
   - Science Robotics: 10.1126/scirobotics.adk3925
   - Materials Science paper: 10.1021/accountsmr.3c00016
   - Physical Chemistry paper: 10.1021/acs.jpcb.3c00016
   - Nanoengineering textbook: 10.1039/9781837672691

### Task 
Optimize website hero section and image display

### Artifact
Made several improvements to enhance the hero section and image display:

1. CSS changes to reduce banner height and improve responsiveness:
```css
.hero {
    height: 70vh;
    position: relative;
    overflow: hidden;
}

@media (max-width: 480px) {
    .hero {
        height: 50vh;
    }
}

@media (min-width: 1921px) {
    .hero {
        height: 60vh;
        max-height: 800px;
    }
}
```

2. Enhanced image display with subtle animations:
```css
.slide img {
    width: 100%;
    height: 100%;
    object-fit: cover;
    filter: brightness(0.8) contrast(1.1) blur(0.5px);
    transform: scale(1.05);
    transition: transform 10s ease-in-out;
}

.slide.active img {
    transform: scale(1.1);
}
```

3. Refined overlay gradient:
```css
.hero::after {
    background: linear-gradient(
        to bottom,
        rgba(44, 62, 80, 0.8) 0%,
        rgba(44, 62, 80, 0.75) 100%
    );
}
```

These changes optimize the presentation while maintaining readability and professional appearance, with responsive behavior across different screen sizes.
